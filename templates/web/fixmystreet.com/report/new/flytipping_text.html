As this is private land Peterborough Council are unable to clear the fly-tip, this is the land owners responsibility. Your report will still be sent to Peterborough Council’s environmental enforcement team who will investigate. Unfortunately, they can’t provide updates on these investigations so your report will be marked as closed once it has been received.
